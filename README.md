Item Relations (plugin for Omeka)
=================================

[Item Relations] is a plugin for [Omeka] that lets you define relations between
items. For example, you can make one item a part of another item, where
"part of" is the relation. You can also make one item a "reproduction of" or a
"translation of" another item.

We've bundled the plugin with common relations derived from several formal
vocabularies, like Dublin Core and FRBR. You can use these or you could populate
a custom vocabulary with the relations needed in your archive. You could, for
example, define custom relations like "is parent of", "is better than", and
"fits within".

See http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/ItemRelations for more info.

This fork adds a quick visual selector and made the item relations themable.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "ItemRelations".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online [plugin issues] and [fork issues].
